#DockJS

```
"Any application that can be written in JavaScript will eventually be written in JavaScript"
— Atwood’s Law
```

...And so we continue writing in Javascript...because...

We are both motivated to learn more and more Javascript each day, to refine our craft, and hone our innovative capacity by advancing through a deeper understanding of our JavaScript's core fundamentals. [ScratchJS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scratch-js/alploljligeomonipppgaahpkenfnfkn?hl=en-US) has always been a great go-to since its release, but we wanted to access a REPL offline from our desktop, and add a few features that take practicing, writing, and learning JavaScript to another level.

In this project, we designed an interpretation of a traditional desktop application using Electron, specifically a JavaScript REPL interface that fully functions offline and can be accessed in the dock in multiple platforms. Since the recent additions to the JavaScript library in ES6/ES7, we wanted to have a feature that allowed a user to upload code in vanilla JS that could be transpiled into ES6, and allow a user to write/upload ES6 and have it b transpiled into Vanilla JS--the learning opportunities in seeing complex JS files or simple lines of code be translated can be powerful. We also offer the user the ability to save their code to a file or upload a file with a '.js' extension.

Since this project was terra incognita, a big part of the learning was to document our travels. To do that we each addressed three main sides to the project:

1. Learning Electron from a higher mental model/view with our chosen library, VueJS. In these posts, we discuss how they work (both individually as well as how they work together), why we chose VueJS, and why we chose them over other alternatives.

2. Particular technical problems that we encountered and how we solved it.
3. A post-mortem on what went well and what you would improve upon if you were to continue working on this project or if you started over
